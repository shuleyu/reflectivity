1. All noise traces are ended with .sac

2. Noise are cut before the P arrival of according record.

3. Before the cut, a butterworth high pass filter with corner 0.02 is applied.

4. After the cut, the mean and trend is removed, sampling is downsampled to 10 Hz.

5. The length of the noise is 400 ~ 500 sec.

6. The begin/end amplitudes are tapered before adding to signal. Because we need to have a continuity.
